      <p id="tribute-info">Here we will talk about the wacky and wild life of space explorer Arthur Dent!</p>
      <p id="spoiler-warning"><b>WARNING!</b> There <i>will</i> be spoilers for the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy book series below so read at your own peril!</p>
      <h3>Pre-Space Adventures</h2>
      <p id="pre-adventure">There isn't a whole lot to say about Arthur Dent prior to his spacefaring adventures, just a pretty normal guy who worked in radio and lived in a rather unremarkable house, that was all soon to change though!</p>
      <h3>Space Adventures</h2>
      <p id="adventure">Oh where to begin? I suppose the destruction planet earth at the beginning of book 1 is a good place to start! All for a space-highway if you can believe it! Anyway following this tragic event Arthur's journey through space begins alongside his good friend, <i>Ford Prefect</i>. Without going into too much detail, I will say Arthur does various fun things such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning to fly!</li>
        <li>Teaching a vending machine about tea!</li>
        <li>Meeting a guy with two heads!</li>
        <li>Killing the same person through many different re-incarnations until they are driven mad!</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Post-Space Adventures</h2>
      <p id="post-adventure">No-one really knows what happens to Arthur Dent after the books... atleast not me beacause I have yet to finish the last one! I will update this section upon completion.</p>
      <h3>Final Words</h3>
      <p id="final-words">I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the adventures of Arthur Dent if you would like to learn a bit more <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Dent" target="_blank">click here</a>! Otherwise, do give the books a read if you haven't already.</p>
